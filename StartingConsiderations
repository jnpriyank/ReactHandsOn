React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. 
It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. ... 
React processes only user interfaces in applications.
it doesn’t make assumptions on rest of your stack so you can use it with different tech stacks.

React is just a fancy library to create user interface of the website. 
If you are aware of any MVC pattern then React is just ‘V’ of the MVC.

Please note that it is not a framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that they were facing.

React allows developers to create large web applications that use data which can change over time, without reloading the page.
Its main goal is to be fast, simple and scalable.
It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components.
With React Js single page application is made easier. It is commonly used in Enterprise applications.

Q. Now you would ask, what makes React so special?
Well, with React, you don’t have to use DOM directly. 
React will create a virtual DOM which will only update (real) DOM whenever there is any change. 
So if you change <h1> tag of your webpage, then with React, only that section will be updated and not the entire webpage.

Q. JSX:
JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. There will HTML tag syntax used to render sub-components.
